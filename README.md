A Guild Wars 2 pathing marker pack for Hero Point trains and more (WIP). 
This pack was made to help Commanders lead their trains, containing pre-made messages that you can copy-to-clipboard. This can (mostly) be disabled via the [Commander Guidance] category. Every marker should still give you room to not interact with it, and in the worst case scenario, you can manually click the interact button that shows up when you are nearby the interactable object (a Hero Point for example).
